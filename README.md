# SHADY PARK PROJECT
 According to the length of the park, the location and height of vertical towers that can block sunlight, and the percentage of the park that must be shaded, the program determines the beginning and ending angles of the sun that cause the park to be too sunny.
 
Input will begin with a line containing 3 integers, N, L, and P (2 ≤ N ≤ 500,000; 1 ≤ L ≤ 1,000,000,000; 1 ≤ P ≤ 100), representing the number of sun-blocking towers, the length of the park, and the percentage of the park that must be shaded. The following N lines will each contain a description of a sun-blocking tower.

The sun-blocking tower description will consist of 2 space separated integers, x and h (0 ≤ x ≤ L; 1 ≤ h ≤ 1,000,000,000), representing the location from the western most point of the park and the height of the tower respectively. The towers will be given in increasing order of the location. No two towers will have the same location. The first tower will always be at location 0, and the last tower will always be at location L.
